# Calorie-Cam
Final Year Project 
Calorie Cam is a new and more modern way to use calorie tracking. These days the health and fitness industry are among the most popular, and it is becoming very common for people to be more concerned about what they eat and staying healthy. Calorie Cam is the future of calorie counting. It makes calorie counting far more efficient and takes away from the painful ordeal of having to manually input the nutritional information like other apps offer. The main goal of my project was to make the mobile app more user friendly and make it faster for people to find out what calories are in certain types of food. 
With the advanced machine learned model and object detection software implemented into the Calorie Cam just simply pointing your phone camera at an item of food will give the user the calorie information instantaneously.
